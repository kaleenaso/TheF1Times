            <p>October 20, 2021 - The 2022 Formula One calendar has finally been dropped by the FIA and the F1 teams as we finally get the schedule for the highly anticipated 23-race season. Traveling to 21 different countries apart from twice to Italy and the US, we travel to all sides of the globe across 5 continents.

            <p>This year will also see the return of the Singapore Grand Prix at the Marina Bay Circuit, the Japanese Grand Prix at the Suzuka International Racing Course, the Canadian Grand Prix in Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, Montreal, and the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne. These were all canceled due to the coronavirus outbreak over the last two years.

            <p>We will also see the inaugural race of the Miami Grand Prix this year on the weekend of May 6 to 8 which will be held at the Hard Rock Stadium named the Miami International Autodrome. Additional safety checks have yet to finalize this Grand Prix but its occurrence in the next season is more or less a guarantee. 
            </p>
            <p>We start off after the winter break of preparation in March at the Sakhir Grand Prix in Bahrain and finish up the season in November in Abu Dhabi at the Yas Marina Circuit. With a summer break between the Budapest, Hungarian Grand Prix, and the Belgian Grand Prix in SPA-Francorchamps, there are 13 races in the first half of the season and 10 after the summer break. 
            </p>
            <p>Some of the announced circuits have yet to sign their contracts, those, in particular, being Imola, Italy; Barcelona, Spain; Austin, Texas, and Singapore. The presence of large crowds this season makes it guaranteed these will be finalized in the near future and will occur on their scheduled weekends. 
            </p>
            <p>With the set of new regulations emplaced next season as well as a new car design, there is a lot happening in the first 6 races of 2022. These first few races will already take place in 4 different continents starting from Asia with Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, then down to Australia followed by Emilia Romagna all the way in Italy. We then go across the Atlantic to Miami then back to Europe for the Spanish Grand Prix. While races in the past were usually grouped by location, the hectic first races scheduled by FIA will be a lot as teams will be traveling across the globe within the first 2 months.
